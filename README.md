##### Goals:



1. Does the theoretical approach of the A‑FFIP manual—with its individual support areas and the exercises ranging from easy to expert—also manifest in practical work with the individual children? In other words, do the children, as assumed, learn progressively through the therapy by working through the corresponding exercises step by step?
2. Which support areas are addressed first? Are there relationships between this and factors such as age, nonverbal and verbal development, core autistic symptomatology, and other behaviors?
3. How do the support areas build on one another, and from which area is the transition made to another? Are there specific patterns here—are these comparable across children, or do different groups of children show internally similar but between‑group different patterns? Are there relationships with age, nonverbal and verbal development, core autistic symptomatology, and other behaviors?



##### Methods:
